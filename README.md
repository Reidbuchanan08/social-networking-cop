# Social Networking Cop – Phase I

## Project Overview

The **Social Networking Cop** is a web-based application designed to promote healthier screen time habits by monitoring and alerting users when they exceed preset daily and weekly usage limits on a faux social media platform called **TimeSpace**.  

Phase I establishes the foundation for this system, including a working user interface, time-tracking logic, and alert functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Safari, Chrome, or Edge recommended).
3. Log in with any username.

- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **LocalStorage API**  
- **Visual Studio Code**  
- **Safari Developer Tools**

## Testing

**Manual Black-Box Testing** was conducted in Phase I to verify:
- Accurate time tracking post-login.
- Proper display of daily and weekly alert prompts.
- Local storage functionality for persisting session data.

Preliminary **unit tests** on timer control and alert trigger functions were conducted through console logs and scenario-based testing.

---

## Known Issues (Phase I)

- No server-side components implemented.
- No persistent database; data only stored in local storage.
- No media (photos/videos) functionality by design.
- Limited styling; UI optimized for function-first demonstration.

---

## Next Steps (Phase II)

- Refine UI design.
- Add detailed session logs.
- Enhance local storage management.
- Explore basic data export options.
- Implement improved user management.
